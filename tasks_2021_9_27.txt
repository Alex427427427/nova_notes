create arm simulator timeline with Tom

software induction task
    ROS2 obstacle detector, due Oct 3rd

arm simulator
    purpose: 
        test out operation during design phase.
        operator training while arm is yet to be manufactured.
        operator training while arm is damaged.
        will live alongside team

    how:
        Unity visualiser
            in: joint angles from the other arm simulator post IK
            manipulation: 
                for joint k, perform forward kinematics from joint 1 up to k.
            out: visualisation of arm current pose. 

            import arm model k times for k joints. For each joint, remove all 
                parts of the arm except for the current link associated with joint k.
                Place joint k at the place specified by forward kinematics.

        future improvement:
            add camera views according to their position on the arm. 
            add ability to adjust camera positions. 


attend meeting with Michelle and TOm
    think through task split and timeline with TOm

COntinue:
    learning Unity  
    understanding features/IK
    prepare altium workshop
